\section{Social Media and Personal Data}
As discussed earlier, social networking sites are web services that allow users
to have an online presence within the scope of the site's network. The question
is what data is collected by these sites and how that data can be used by third
parties as well as the controls that users have over their personal data.

Personal Data is a different subset of data than what people usually associate
with themselves. The typical name, address, phone, etc are just a few points of data
that can be used by different individuals or companies to glean information
about a person. Many social networks collect and use far more data than this as
part of the profiles on their sites. How this data is collected and used is
entirely based on the site but in general social networking sites offer a free
service to users in exchange for showing ads based on a profile that is built
using data that is submitted to the site.

As part of the web2.0 movement many websites added social features to their
sites. Game websites added commenting a crowd-sourced reviews about games. Online
retailers added reviews and allowed users to see what their friends thought of
products. These tools were added to grow interest and increase interaction
between customers and the services offered. More page views usually means more
ad clicks or product sales. As an extension of this many social networking sites
added Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) to their web services allowing
third party programmers to create new and innovative interfaces to their system.
This increased interaction with the service and grew the service's user base.

APIs are documented hook in points for programmers to interact with another
system. To look at it from another view would to see APIs as a computer program
with a window that allows you to control the output of a text box. Using
different switches, buttons, sliders, etc. the user is able to create exactly
the output that they want. For programmers is is useful because they can query
the service for data and receive a string containing the data that they want.

Any reputable website or web application will have a privacy policy and a terms
of use which will explain to the site's users how data collected will be used
and who the data will be shared with. These documents lay out exactly the rules
with which the site may be used by consumers and explains to the user the type
of functions their data may play. These policies play a huge role in the use of
APIs as well. Users may use the APIs to interact with the services but they
limit some of the uses. One limitation may include a no spam policy allowing web
services to terminate API access to tools which abuse the service.

Privacy policies, terms of use, APIs, and data collection all play a huge role
in the growth and adoption of social networking platforms. We will look into
several sites data collection, API access, and privacy polices to glean some
idea of how some of these sites use user data. These sites are divided into two
major sections social networks with geo-location features including Facebook and
Twitter and location dependent social networks such as FourSquare, Gowalla,
Loopt, and Yobonga.
