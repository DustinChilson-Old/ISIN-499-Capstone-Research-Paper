Overall the privacy issues that are associated with social media may seem to be
acceptable to most users. The problem lies in how widespread the information can
be shared. The solution to most problems is education and this problem is no
different. Users need to be aware of the reach that their data may have and the
impact it may have on them.

Sharing data on social media sites is safe as long as a user is willing to
submit themselves to highly targeted ads. This may be a great tradeoff for some
users who like the free service and don't mind ads. For others it may seem like
an invation of privacy that a company knows everything about them and uses that
information for monitary gain.

The impact of sharing infomation is becoming more and more of a known as research
into social media and the Internet as a whole takes place. Law enforcement is
using social media profiles to find criminals and businesses are doing extensive
background checks before even offering an interview. The data that is shared
publicly can cause issues if the data is not managed properly.

This paper explored some of the most popular social networks as well as the
ramifications of using those applications. Location data may seem irrelivent to
some but can have an impact on a person's life in ways that cannot be predicted.
