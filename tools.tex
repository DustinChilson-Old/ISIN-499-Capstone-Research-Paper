\section{Tools for Keeping track of public data}
There are tools that are available for uses to track what data is available about
them as well as limit the data that is collected. As a great security practice
is is very useful to limit the exposure of personal data to the world. Just as
keeping a close eye on ones credit score it is important to keep track of what
data is available on the internet. This section will explain some of the many
tools that are available for users to track the data available on the internet
as well as introduce some tools that can be used to protect their personal data.

\subsection{Tracking Tools}
To keep track of the data that is available on the internet there are several
options available. The tools can be as simplistic as visiting every site that
there is an account associated with a person and looking around and a search
using Google. The tools can also be extremely sophisticated and custom built for
the purpose of tracking social media reputation. 

Reputation is something that many companies and individuals need to be concerned
about. Corporations, elected officials, CEOs, and even private citizens may need
to track the impact of data on the internet. For this reason there are custom
built services that track the data that is mentioned all over the internet and
aggregates it into one place for easy analysis. 

Some applications that will scrape all sites for mentions of include
Radian6\footnote{http://www.radian6.com/products/radian6-dashboard/} and 
Trackur\footnote{http://www.trackur.com/}. These applications search the
scraped version of the internet and applies a filter based on the keywords that
are supplied to the application. 

Radian6 describes itself as a "flexible, web-based social media monitoring and 
engagement platform that lets you view relevant conversations happening around 
your brand and products in real time. We aggregate those conversations – saving 
you lots of legwork – and put them into visuals that make analysis and 
measurement meaningful and actionable."~\cite{Radian6}

This may be far more than what is required for the casual user or job seeker.
There are also open source web applications that aggrigate all of the posts
about, by, and to a user on many of the social media sites. One such project is
called ThinkUp
